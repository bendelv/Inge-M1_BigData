# Big Data Project EU CO2 emissions
## PLANS

### NEXT MILESTONE
* Why this question has to be stated? (actual situation)
* Study of carbon dynamic.
* present naive SECTORS of emissions (individual, public, private, ..). What are the factors of growth of these sectors ?
* What are the strategies in place to reduce CO2 emission in these sectors ?
* present naive FACTORS of emissions (transport, heating, wastes, energies ..)
* How to calculate CO2 emissions? [HERE]()

### LONG TERM ROADMAP 
1. State of EU production/consummation.   
(/!\ Be careful about to whom belong consummation)   

2. Find EU directives about CO2 emissions

## RESEARCH QUESTIONS
* What means to be enough? (*)
* Link between co2 emission and energy production
* Link between co2 emission and energy consumption
* How can we modeling co2 cycle? Natural? Human? Interactions?
* What is the frontier of the emission of a country (importation of products containing embedded carbon, etc ) ?
* What are the planned strategies? What are the probabilities that they be actually applied ?
* Energetic dependence of countries (?)
* Match between production and consummation and loss occasioned. (?)
* Allocation of fossil energy for elec (?)

 /!\ Which UNITS to use to present? /!\  
  
  (?) is this Q relevant?  - (*) seems to make sense
