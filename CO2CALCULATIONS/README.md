# HOW TO CALCULATE CO2 EMISSIONS?

## CURTIS NOTES

### [Prediction and Analysis of CO2 Emission in Chongqing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5877075/)

__Lire toute l'analyse ! -> TRES INTERESSANT.__

__Small summary:__

Here the CO2 emissions is computed in function of the fossil energy consumption.  
In this papar a prediction of the CO2 emission for the year 2020 is predicted (they have the data from 1997 to 2015). I did not read the part where he talks about prediction.

Structure of the paper.

1) They first predict the fossil energy consumption and the corresponding CO2 emission.
2) Then with the energy intensity of 2015 and the energy intensity of 2020 (target of the government), the fossil energy consumption
   and the corresponding CO2 emission is predicted.

Energy intenity -> total energy consumption
CO2 intensity -> CO2 emission


---------------------------------------------------------------------

For us :

1) Find the total fuel energy consumption in Europe and its distribution in function of the types of energy.
2) Fossil energy consumption = Coal + coke + gasoline + diesel oil + crude oil + kerosene + fuel oil + natural gas (*)
3) Do a bar plot of their quantities and if two or more of them are not significant separately -> combine them
4) Table 1 of the paper !!!!
5) There is an equation for the emission of CO2 in function of the fossil energy consumption

(*) Those data are used to compute the emission of CO2.

###[DATASET: CO2 emissions from electricity gen.](https://www.kaggle.com/berhag/co2-emission-forecast-with-python-seasonal-arima)

This paper is practically the same than the previous paper but data he chose are only for the electric power sector.
Paper5 is more accurate by the way.

Good analyse, can be inspired by it.

It is a monthly dataset that started in 1973 about carbon dioxide emissions from ELECTRICITY GENERATION. The dataset includes CO2 emissions from each energy resource.
