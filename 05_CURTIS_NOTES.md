# CURTIS NOTES

## REMARKS

 - (BEN) CO2CALCULATIONS/CURTIS (1.):  
 Check for term __IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories__.  
 Give equations about how to estimate co2 emission etc.

Total greenhouse gas emissions in kt of CO2 EQUIVALENT are composed of CO2 totals EXCLUDING short-cycle biomass burning (such as agricultural waste burning and Savannah burning) but INCLUDING other biomass burning (such as forest fires, post-burn decay, peat fires and decay of drained peatlands), all anthropogenic CH4 sources, N2O sources and F-gases (HFCs, PFCs and SF6).

-__To do__:  
- Greenhouse gases produced by burning fossil fuels graphs
- CO2 emissions graphs
- Greenhouse gases by sector of activity graphs
- Try to compare them in order to make choices and not work on all the countries of the EU.
- Try to compare then in order to show why chosing to point out CO2 and not others greenhouse gases.
-  Use plotly for the graphs
-  Wouldn't it be better to do a markdown instead of slides for the presentation ?
-  Bar plot, pie plot, times series -> look for interesting time series analysis also
