# GLOSSARY

## Definitions
- __Energy intensity__:  
A measure of the energy efficiency of an economy.  
It is calculated as units of energy per unit of GDP.

- __CO2 equivalent__:  
The CO2 equivalent is, for a GREENHOUSE GAS, the quantity of CO2 that would cause the same RADIATIVE FORCING as this gas,
i.e. that would have the same capacity to retain solar radiation. It is expressed by applying a conversion factor, the global warming potential (GWP), which depends on the length of the period considered.

- __Radiative forcing or climate forcing__:  
Radiative forcing or climate forcing is the difference between insolation (radiative energy received by the sun) absorbed by the Earth and energy radiated back to space. A system in thermal equilibrium has zero radiative forcing. Changes that modify Earth's radiative equilibrium
are called climate forcings.  
Positive radiative forcing means Earth receives more incoming energy from sunlight than it radiates to space. This net gain of energy will cause warming.
Negative radiative forcing means that Earth loses more energy to space than it receives from the sun, which produces cooling.
A system in thermal equilibrium has zero radiative forcing.

- __Greenhouse gases__:  
A greenhouse gas (GHG) is a gas that absorbs and emits radiant energy within the thermal infrared range.
Greenhouse gases cause the greenhouse effect.

- __Greenhouse effect__:  
The greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms the Earth’s surface. When the Sun’s energy reaches the Earth’s atmosphere,
some of it is reflected back to space and the rest is absorbed and re-radiated by greenhouse gases.


- __Global warming potential__:  
Global warming potential (GWP) is a measure of how much heat a greenhouse gas traps in the atmosphere up to a specific
time horizon, relative to carbon dioxide. It compares the amount of heat trapped by a certain mass of the gas in question to the amount of heat trapped by a similar mass of carbon dioxide and is expressed as a factor of carbon dioxide (whose GWP is standardized to 1).
A GWP is calculated over a specific time horizon, commonly 20, 100, or 500 years

## Acronymes

- __GHG (Greenhouse gases)__:  

- __ETS (Emission Trading System)__:  

Process in which companies can trade emission allowance to one another and this is done for a given cap (calculated goal for entire UE aviation diff).
It contains all UE countries as well as Lichtenstein, Iceland and Norway.  
For CO2, the sector contained by ETS are : Power and heat generation, energy-intensive industry sectors,
commercial aviation.

- __ESD (Effort Sharing Decision)__:  

National annual binding targets for emissions not covered under the EU emission trading scheme (ETS).  
The ESD emissions are calculated by deducting ETS verified emissions, CO2 emissions from
domestic aviation and NF3 emissions from national total emissions.

- __GWP (Global Warming Potential)__:  

 -> for gazes

- __GDP (Gross Domestic Product)__:  
"PIB"

 ## International agreements
 - __Paris agreement__ :  

Paris Agreement sets out a global framework to avoid dangerous climate change by
limiting global warming to well below 2°C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C.  
It also aims to strengthen countries’ ability to deal with the impacts of climate change and support them in their efforts.
 
 - __Protocole de Kyoto__:
 
 Accord international visant à la réduction des émissions de gaz à effet de serre et qui vient s'ajouter à la Convention-cadre
 des Nations unies sur les changements climatiques dont les pays participants se rencontrent une fois par an depuis 1995.
