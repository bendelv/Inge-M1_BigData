We begin with a modest review of the literature on the concepts that led to a final solution. In the second section, narratives of different families of scenario used by IPCC are described and our approach of scenario-based forecasting is explained. Then a section is reserved for the data set we used, whether it be for observed data, i.e. between 1990 and 2017, or data used to forecast CO2 emissions. The following section makes a correlation study of the different variables encountered in the dataset. Logically after this correlation study, we investigate how these variables directly impact CO emissions via a sentivity analysis. This section is followed by a section dealing with the different models we have considered in order to predict CO2 emissions. No one knows what the CO2 emissions will look like 10 years from now, so there is a section dedicated to the uncertainty associated with these estimates and the uncertainties that we were able to identify in the course of our project. The application of Monte Carlo simulation using scenario families is detailed and motivated. And finally, we present the results and compare them with various projections as well as the objective set by the European Union. We end our project with a discussion the limitations of our project.
