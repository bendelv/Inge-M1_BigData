# Big Data Project EU CO2 emissions
## OVERLEAF RAPPORTS
- [Milestone 1](https://www.overleaf.com/4995682689wckysczrmrvv)


## PLANS

### NEXT MILESTONE (PV 2019-11-25)
1. Why this question has to be stated? (actual situation)  
[ ] What is Green House gas Effect?  
[ ] What are actual Green House gas?  
[ ] Why narrow research to CO2 emissions?  

2. Study of carbon dynamics.  
[ ] What is CO2? How does it interact with environment?  
[ ] What are main SOURCES of emissions?  

3. What are the strategies in place to reduce CO2 emissions?  
[ ] National/EU/International policies and agreements in place?  
[ ] Are those policies followed by governments?  

4. How to estimate CO2 emissions in a region?  
[ ] What does exist in literature?    
[ ] How could we calculate historic emissions? What are variables?  
[ ] How could we forecast emissions?

5. What's our roadmap for the next 6 months?  
[ ] Identify clusters of countries in UE based on type of CO2 emissions.  
[ ] Check emissions models calculations with recent data gathering.

## RESEARCH QUESTIONS
* What are factors of growth of CO2 emissions? Trends? Dynamics btw sources?
* Link between co2 emission and energy production
* Link between co2 emission and energy consumption
* What is the frontier of the emission of a country (importation of products containing embedded carbon, etc ) ?
* Match between production and consummation and loss occasioned. (?)
* Allocation of fossil energy for elec (?)

 /!\ Which UNITS to use to present? /!\  
  
  (?) is this Q relevant?  - (*) seems to make sense
