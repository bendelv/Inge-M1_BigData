# Big Data Project EU CO2 emissions

## PLANS

### FEED BACK MS1
* Scope too big
* Unrealistic to asses policy impacts?
* Need a timeline

### PV 2019-12-02
* Re do timeline
* Do experiences on Belgium data -> get a methodology
* Assemble databases (co2 measures - demography .. -energy mix- .. - PIB - .. )
* Choose a baseline/benchmark - method and 'business as usual' predicitons

## RESEARCH QUESTIONS
* What are factors of growth of CO2 emissions? Trends? Dynamics btw sources?
* Link between co2 emission and energy production
* Link between co2 emission and energy consumption
* What is the frontier of the emission of a country (importation of products containing embedded carbon, etc ) ?
* Match between production and consummation and loss occasioned. (?)
* Allocation of fossil energy for elec (?)

 /!\ Which UNITS to use to present? /!\  
  
  (?) is this Q relevant?  - (*) seems to make sense
