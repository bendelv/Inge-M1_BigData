# Big Data Project EU CO2 emissions
## PLANS

### NEXT MILESTONE
* General

* Production
1. Which form of energy?
2. Whom product what as energy?
3. In which proportion?

* Consummation
1. Which country consume? What?
2. 

* Emission
1. Which form of energy produces CO2 (and other emissions?)

### NEXT MILESTONE V2
* Why this question has to be stated? (actual situation)
* IN DEPTH study of carbon cycle (*)
* present naive SECTORS of emissions (individual, public, private, ..)
* present naive FACTORS of emissions (transport, heating, wastes, energies ..)
* 

### LONG TERM ROADMAP 
1. State of EU production/consummation.   
(/!\ Be careful about to whom belong consummation)   

2. Find EU directives about CO2 emissions

## RESEARCH QUESTIONS
* What means to be enough? (*)
* Link between co2 emission and energy production
* Link between co2 emission and energy consumption
* How can we modeling co2 cycle? Natural? Human? Interactions?
* Energetic dependence of countries (?)
* Match between production and consummation and loss occasioned. (?)
* Allocation of fossil energy for elec (?)

 /!\ Which UNITS to use to present? /!\  
  
  (?) is this Q relevant?  - (*) seems to make sense
